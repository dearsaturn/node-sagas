# Kafka Sagas ðŸŒ¼

Kafka-sagas is a package that allows you to use eerily similar semantics to [Redux-Sagas](https://redux-saga.js.org/) built on top of [KafkaJS](https://kafka.js.org/). With Kafka-Sagas, Kafka topics are treated as streams that a saga can dispatch actions into, as well as tapped for particular actions to initiate a saga.

### Concepts

## Consumer

## Saga

## Action

## Effect

## Transaction

## Communication between sagas
